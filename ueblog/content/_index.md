## Hi, I'm Kai 

I’m a cybersecurity graduate student with a background in computer science and hands-on experience in IT support, 
system administration, and web management.  

I’m interested in the diagnostic and investigative side of cybersecurity (areas like digital forensics, incident response, and 
technical auditing) and how they connect to building secure, reliable systems. I enjoy combining analytical 
problem-solving with practical technology skills to help improve security and efficiency in any environment.  

Here, I share projects, insights, and notes from my journey in cybersecurity and technology.
